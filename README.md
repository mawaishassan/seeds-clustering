# seeds-clustering

In this project, the task was to differentiate and assign different seeds into the clusters and draw the visualization of these cluster in compressed dimensions. The given data set contains following features: Area, perimeter, compactness, kernel_length,kernel_width, and asymmetry_coefficien. The task was to identify the best number of clusters for the given data and then assign the seeds to these clusters, convert higher demensional data into 2 Dimensions using PCA and finally visualize the clusters with optimal number of clusters.
